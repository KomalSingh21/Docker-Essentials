Create a DockerHub account at https://hub.docker.com
 
In your VM terminal Login to your DockerHub account using the docker login command; provide your DockerHub username and password when prompted and make sure the login is successful


Now tag ct-wordpress:v1 image as <your dockerhub account name>/ct-wordpress:v1 for pushing the image to DockerHub. Verify the tag is correct 


# docker tag ct-wordpress:v1 <dockerhub account>/ct-wordpress:v1
 # docker image ls


Push the Docker image to DockerHub by using docker push command, you will see only the committed layer getting pushed while the layers which are already present in DockerHub are only getting mounted

# docker push <dockerhub account>/ct-wordpress:v1


Go to your DockerHub account in the browser and refresh the repositories page to verify the creation of a new repository ct-wordpress


Verify the tag of the pushed image as well, which, as per the steps followed above, is v1
 
Now use your image which is pushed to your Docker Hub to create a new container in detached mode, you will see the pull is happening only for the missing layer.
# docker run -d -p 8080:80 <dockerhub account>/ct-wordpress:v1
 


Open the browser and access your WordPress website using Public_IP:8080
